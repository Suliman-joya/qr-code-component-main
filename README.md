## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

📘 What I Learned from This Project

This QR Code Component project helped me strengthen my foundational HTML and CSS skills. Here is what I practiced and learned:

🔹 Semantic and Clean HTML Structure

- Built a simple and accessible layout using semantic tags like <main>, <section>, and <figure>.

- Organized content into a reusable card component.

- Improved image handling with proper alt text practices.

🔹 Centering Layouts with Flexbox

- Used Flexbox to center the card both vertically and horizontally.

- Applied flex-direction: column to organize elements inside the card.

🔹 Working with Responsive Units

- Used rem units for consistent spacing and typography.

- Set the root font size to 62.5% to simplify scaling (1rem = 10px).

🔹 Modern Card UI Styling

- Added rounded corners, background color, and box shadow to create a clean and modern look.

- Used Google Fonts ("Outfit") to enhance typography.

- Applied balanced spacing with padding and margins for better visual structure.

🔹 Responsive Image and Layout Control

- Ensured the QR code image scales properly by setting width: 100%.

- Applied padding and border radius to integrate the image smoothly with the card design.

🔹 Clean and Organized CSS

- Used a global reset to keep styling consistent across browsers.

- Maintained clear and readable class names.

- Grouped styling logically for better maintainability.

```html
Semantic HTML
<main>
  <section><figure></figure></section>
</main>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px 0 rgba(31, 49, 79, 0.4);
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me for box shadow reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
